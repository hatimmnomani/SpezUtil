# @spezutil/hijri-view-core

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix "today"/"now" resolving against UTC instead of the viewer's local timezone, which could highlight the wrong day, jump the Today button to the wrong day, and misplace the current-time indicator near local midnight. `<hijri-calendar>` and `<hijri-datepicker>` now default to the viewer's local timezone and accept an optional `timezone` attribute/property (IANA name) to pin resolution to a fixed zone. Also fixes event date strings carrying an explicit UTC offset/`Z` suffix being misparsed as bare wall-clock values.
- Updated dependencies
